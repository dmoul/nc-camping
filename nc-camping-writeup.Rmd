# Introduction

Inspired by Tyler McIntosh's article [The Camping Crunch: Camping's rise in popularity on America's public lands](https://westernpriorities.org/the-camping-crunch/)^[*The Camping Crunch: Camping's rise in popularity on America's public lands* was published Oct 21, 2021 on the website of the Center or Western Priorities at https://westernpriorities.org/the-camping-crunch/ . I found it through a reference in Jeremy Singer-Vines' excellent newsletter *Data is Plural*], I decided to use the same data sets from recreation.gov^[I downloaded data sets from https://ridb.recreation.gov/download on 2021-11-11, specifically (1) overview information in RIDB Recreation Data at https://ridb.recreation.gov/downloads/RIDBFullExport_V1_JSON.zip and (2) historical data for each year FY 2006 - FY 2020 as zipped CSV files, e.g, https://ridb.recreation.gov/downloads/reservations2020.zip for 2020] to look at camping dynamics in North Carolina, where I live.

I wondered, in North Carolina ...

* The facilities
    - What are the public facilities offering overnight camping, and where are they?
    - What types of sites do they offer?
    - How many are "big" (which I define as having at least `r big_campground_size` campsites)?
    - What is the distribution of the number of sites per facility?
    - Which government agencies provide these facilities?
* Person-nights of camping
    - How many nights are people camping each year, and how has this been changing over time?
    - Which parks have become more popular in recent years? Have any become less popular?
    - How much revenue are parks collecting related to overnight camping, and how has this been changing?
* Occupancy rates
    - How does the occupancy vary by day of week? By week of year? What changes have there been in occupancy rate over the years? Are some parks often at maximum occupancy?
* Reservations
    - How far in advance do people reserve?
* Costs per person
    - What does it cost to camp, and how has this changed over the years?
* Similarity to rest of the USA
    - Are the dynamics similar to the rest of the country?

<br>

## What's possible given these data sets?

First we have to check: what's in the data, and are there any important limitations? I found four:

1. [recreation.gov](https://recreation.gov/) mostly processes reservations for federal facilities. It does not process reservations for state-owned public campgrounds in North Carolina. NC State Parks use [ReserveAmerica.com](https://ReserveAmerica.com/) instead, thus the campgrounds closest to my home in the [Jordan Lake State Recreation Area](https://www.ncparks.gov/jordan-lake-state-recreation-area/home) and my favorite at [Mount Mitchell](https://www.ncparks.gov/mount-mitchell-state-park/home) are not included in this data set. As noted at https://www.ncparks.gov/find-a-park :

    >There are 41 places that are currently part of the North Carolina State Parks system: 34 parks, four recreation areas, and three staffed state natural areas.

2. Some campsites are not reservable. Some may not be reservable in the off season, so by definition, use of these sites will not show up in this data set.

3. As is visible in the per-campground trend data starting with [camping person-nights by park], there are a lot of outliers in the data in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Likely there are two causes: 
    - Data for 2018 and first half of 2019 are less reliable than other years as explained in the 2018 history readme:

        >Due to the transition between Rec.gov vendors the FY 2018 historical reservation data has not been fully verified for accuracy and completeness.

    - In 2020 due the the COVID-19 pandemic, people changed their behavior significantly, and camping facilities were closed for some periods of the year. For example, I can imagine that group campsites would be used less frequently, and group size would be much smaller than earlier years.

4. As noted at [trailandsummit.com](https://trailandsummit.com/every-type-of-campsite-defined-camping-faqs/) the definition of "standard", "tent" and "RV" overlap, which means counts and trends below that distinguish among these categories may not reflect the experience of campers, for example, in the available of a campsite *for them*:

    >In most campgrounds, the term “standard campsite” is interchangeable with a “basic campsite.” Like basic sites, standard campsites usually have a driveway, a picnic table, and a fire ring or grill, and are normally reserved for groups of 6 people or less. Depending on the type of campground, standard sites may be suitable for tents or RVs, though they’re mostly used by tent campers. This is because most standard sites have driveways that are only suitable for smaller campers and campervans. That being said, in RV-only campgrounds, standard campsites may refer to a site where you get everything listed above, plus a simple electric hookup, but no water or sewer.


```{r}
fy2020_summary <- nc_history %>%
  filter(year == 2020) %>%
  summarize(person_nights = sum(person_nights),
            revenue = sum(total_paid))

```

<br>

## Our focus is federally-owned facilities in NC

So setting aside the NC State Park system, we will focus here on federal facilities in NC, which amidst the oddities of 2020 provided `r comma(fy2020_summary$person_nights)` person-nights of camping and collected `r dollar(fy2020_summary$revenue)` in overnight camping fees. 

I will refer to the facilities as campgrounds and campsites even though some are cabins, lodges, lookouts, and shelters.

<br>

# Federal agencies, camping facilities and campsites

The following federal agencies offer overnight camping with reservations via recreation.gov:

<br>

```{r}
nc_history %>%
  left_join(.,
            federal_org_info,
            by = c("parent_org_id" = "org_id")
  ) %>%
  distinct(facility_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  #distinct(parent_org_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  count(org_name, org_abbrev_name, org_url_address,
        name = "n_facilities") %>% #, facility_name, name = "n_reservations") %>%
  select(org_name, n_facilities, org_abb = org_abbrev_name, org_url = org_url_address) %>% #, facility_name, n_reservations)
  arrange(-n_facilities) %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(md(glue("**Federal agencies offering overnight camping reservations**",
                     "<br>via recreation.gov in NC")))

```

<br><br>

## Park locations

Parks are nearly all in the mountains in the West or at coast in the East.

```{r}
# TODO: use df with consolidated names and n_sites or avg_person_nights

# Crabtree Falls 35.8195°N 82.1508°W

nc_parks_for_map <- park_years %>%

         facility_name = str_remove(facility_name, " Group(.*$)?"),
         facility_name = str_remove(facility_name, " Cabin(.*$)?"),
         name_first_word = str_extract(facility_name, "\\w+")
         ) %>%
  distinct(name_first_word, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  select(name_first_word, facility_name, agency, ends_with("tude")) %>%
  left_join(.,
            nc_parks_site_types %>%
              group_by(name_first_word) %>%
              summarize(n_sites = sum(n_sites)) %>%
              ungroup(),
            by = "name_first_word") %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("facility_longitude", "facility_latitude")) %>%
  st_set_crs("NAD83") #"EPSG:32119") # NAD83 for NC

                                )

```

```{r nc-map, out.width="100%", fig.width=8}
#fig.height=6

ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = nc_counties, color = "grey50", size = 0.1, fill = "tan", alpha = 0.2) +

        legend.justification = "center") +
  labs(title = "NC public facilities with overnight reservations",
       subtitle = glue("at recreation.gov {year_lower_bound} - 2020"),
       color = "Agency:",
       size = "Number of sites:"
  )
```

<br>

## Number of campsites

About half of the campgrounds have at least 50 campsites:

```{r nc-site-count-ecdf, out.width="100%", fig.width=8}
nc_campsites %>%
  count(facility_id_group, facility_name, name = "n_sites") %>%
  ggplot(aes(n_sites)) +
  stat_ecdf(size = 2, color = "firebrick") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 50, lty = 2, color = "firebrick", alpha = 0.4) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 50, 100, 200, 300)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format()) +
  labs(title = glue("Percent of all {nrow(distinct(nc_parks_site_types, facility_id_group))}", 
                    " NC campgrounds \nwith at least n_site campsites"),
       y = "")
```

<br>

There are `r nrow(distinct(nc_parks_site_types, facility_id_group))` federal facilities in North Carolina offering reservations through recreation.gov, which I consolidated from `r nrow(distinct(nc_history, facility_id)) ` separate `facility_id` values (some parks record cabins or group campgrounds as separate facilities).

<br>

# Person-nights

These facilities provided nearly 7 million person-nights of camping 2009-2020.

Some notes:

* A `person_night` is one person camping one night. So if four people camp on a Friday and Saturday night, that's 8 person_nights. Based on personal experience organizing group camping events for Scouts, I think person-night counts for group sites are probably less accurate than the others (but likely within 10% of actual).
* For most facilities, the data set includes separate `feature_id` values for each site_type offered. Some have slightly different names, for example, I have combined *Cataloochee Group Camp + Cataloochee Horse Camp + Cataloochee Campground* into one `facility_name` with a common `facility_id_group`.
* For each `facility_id_group`, `n_sites` is a count of distinct `product_id` values. I am assuming that in general `product_id` values have not changed over time, and the same value is not used for multiple campsites at the same facility. For details see [There is some reuse of product_id values (unfortunately)].

### Camping person-nights by park

<br>

The number of yearly person-nights has been increasing in most parks:

<br>

Part 1:

![NC camping person-nights per year by campground (part 1)](`r here("figures", "nc_camping_person_nights_by_campsite_part1.png")`)

<br> 
Part 2:

![NC camping person-nights per year by campground (part 2)](`r here("figures", "nc_camping_person_nights_by_campsite_part2.png")`)

<br>

### Camping revenue by park

Likewise camping revenue has been increasing in most parks, with 2020 being an anomaly for many of them.

## Are the increases occurring during a particular time of the year?

Defining the summer season to be the four months `r month(summer_season_start, label = TRUE)` `r day(summer_season_end)` to `r month(summer_season_end, label = TRUE)` `r day(summer_season_end)`, we see most camps are busiest during the summer. And while the number of camping person-nights has increased year-round, for most campgrounds, more of the growth has been during the summer:

```

<br>

The increasing yearly number of person-nights occurred for all nights. The most noticeable anomaly is extra Sunday, Monday and Tuesday night camping in 2020. Presumably this was due to the pandemic shutdown, perhaps because people had fewer recreational options than other years. The unusually low off-season 2020 numbers probably reflect camp closures.

# Occupancy

## What is the occupancy rate at NC campgrounds, and when are they fullest?

I define the daily percent occupancy as each day's percent of the maximum recorded occupancy for the campground + site type. Is 100% occupancy rate the same as max occupancy? I cannot determine that from the data. Can we assume that each campground + site type reached 100% occupancy at least once? If so, then yes, max occupancy would mean 100% occupancy.

Yearly percent occupancy is the average of the occupancy rate for all days of the year.

The difference in occupancy rates off-season and during the summer are not as different as I expected. This may be due to the climate in NC: the most pleasant times to camp are in the spring and fall. Scouting and other community groups are most likely to camp in the off-season (while school is in session).

```

Some observations

* Autumn is a very popular time to camp--more than the spring.
* There aren't many campgrounds offering overnight reservations during the winter months.
* The 2019 and 2020 data seem suspect, especially for group sites.
* In 2020 it looks like most facilities were closed at the end of September.

# Reservations

## How far ahead do people reserve?

As one might expect, sites in limited supply are booked earlier: more than a third of group sites and more than a quarter of of cabins are booked six months before the start date. In contrast: consistently, only a third of tent sites are reserved 30 days in advance.

It looks like in the early years one could reserve most cabins with 6 months lead time. Then for 2012 and later years the cabin policy changed to 12 months lead time. 

Standard, tent, rv, and equestrian sites can be reserved six months in advance.

The data for 2018 and 2019 seem to have some errors, which are visible in the upper right of each plot: why are there order dates after start_date? These are the only two years in which this pattern is visible in the plots. 

I note again here that some parks have sites that are first-come, first-serve (i.e., they are not reservable). By definition those sites do not show up here.

```{r reservation-pattern-by-year, fig.height=9, fig.width=12, out.width="100%"}
nc_history %>%
  mutate(days_order_to_start = start_date - order_date,
         #invalid_start_date = if_else(order_date > start_date + 1, 1, NULL), # not using this
         site_type_simple = fct_reorder(site_type_simple, person_nights, sum)
         ) %>%
  filter(year >= year_lower_bound,
         !site_type_simple %in% c("management", "shelter")) %>%

There has been a general trend towards reserving earlier:

```{r reservation-pattern-by-type, fig.height=9, fig.width=12, out.width="100%"}
nc_history %>%
  filter(year >= year_lower_bound,
         !site_type_simple %in% c("management", "shelter")) %>%
  mutate(days_order_to_start = start_date - order_date,
         invalid_start_date = if_else(order_date > start_date + 1, 1, NULL),
         
         site_type_simple = fct_reorder(site_type_simple, person_nights, sum),
         year = factor(year)
         ) %>%
  select(year, site_type_simple, days_order_to_start) %>%

```

The plots above mask differences in individual campgrounds. As you would expect some parks are more popular then others.

Most properties are seeing earlier reservations over the years. Swan Cabin is experiencing the opposite trend.

The most popular group campgrounds seem to be Cove Creek Upper and Lower Group Camp, and Kuykendall Group Camp. Other group campsites are included with other site types, so if they have the same dynamic, it's not visible in these plots.

Cabins and Group Camps are the most likely to show a linear-like increase in reservations over time (after the early birds reserve as soon as reservations open).

Judged by early reservations, Bandits Roost seems to have the most popular standard camp sites:

```{r reservation-pattern-standard, fig.height=9, fig.width=12, out.width="100%"}
nc_history_for_plot %>%
  filter(site_type_simple %in% c("standard")) %>%
  plot_order_to_start_by_site_type(.)

```

<br>

Big Creek and Mt Pisgah have about 25% of tent sites booked 90 days before start date, followed by Badin Lake and Black Mountain. It's interesting that five of the 16 campsites only started offering reservations through recreation.gov in recent years.

```{r reservation-pattern-tent, fig.height=9, fig.width=12, out.width="100%"}
nc_history_for_plot %>%
  filter(site_type_simple %in% c("tent")) %>%
  plot_order_to_start_by_site_type(.)

```

<br>

Cove Creek and Kuykendall group camps seem most popular, with nearly half the group reservations made a year in advance--as soon as the reservations opened. Next most popular are by Cataloochee and White Pines. Briar Bottom and North Mills River have seen remarkable increases in early reservations in recent years.

```{r reservation-pattern-group, fig.height=9, fig.width=12, out.width="100%"}
nc_history_for_plot %>%
  filter(site_type_simple %in% c("group")) %>%
  plot_order_to_start_by_site_type(.)

```

<br>

Wash Creek looks like the only equestrian camp to allow bookings a year in advance. Among the rest, Cataloohee has the most consistent reservation pattern over the years.

```{r reservation-pattern-horse, fig.height=9, fig.width=12, out.width="100%"}
nc_history_for_plot %>%
  filter(site_type_simple == "equestrian") %>%
  plot_order_to_start_by_site_type(.)

```

<br>

With RV sites, Lake Powhatan and Smokemont have the biggest early surge when reservations open six months in advance.

While Powhatan has been 75% booked 30 days in advance, Linville Falls has been less 50% booked 15-20 days ahead.

```{r reservation-pattern-rv, fig.height=9, fig.width=12, out.width="100%"}
nc_history_for_plot %>%
  filter(site_type_simple == "rv") %>%
  plot_order_to_start_by_site_type(.)

```

<br>

For the camps that allow cabin reservations a year in advance, Balsam Lake books faster than Great Island or Long Point. Of those that take bookings six months in advance, Swan books much faster than Cheoah Point.

```{r reservation-pattern-cabin, fig.height=6, fig.width=12, out.width="100%"}
nc_history_for_plot %>%

# Cost per person-night

## What does it cost per person, and how has that changed?

Median cabin cost per person doubled in 2012, and equestrian per-person cost grew 2013- 2017. Otherwise median prices were generally stable. Note that these costs are not inflation-adjusted.

Per-person costs at group and equestrian sites in 2020 seem like an aberration: either the more expensive sites were not used much, group sizes were a lot larger (seems unlikely during the pandemic), or there was some other change in usage pattern. Or there could be a problem with the data.

```{r nc-great-value, fig.width=8}

# Summary

Truly there are more people camping more nights at NC public facilities. The clearest increase can be seen in [Are there trends by day of the week?] in the plot *NC camping each night of the week (person-nights)*: each year, each day of the week, in the summer and off-season, there were more people camping (until the pandemic derailed the trend in 2020).

I wonder whether growth at the NC state parks was similar over this time period. My hunch is that the NC parks are more often at max occupancy, so the growth rate may be capped. If the same data were available from ReserveAmerica.com perhaps I would do a similar analysis. Supposedly there is an API at https://developer.active.com/docs/read/Campground_APIs, however the comments suggest it is no longer available. The North Carolina Division of Parks and Recreation is part of the [N.C. Department of Natural and Cultural Resources](https://www.ncdcr.gov/about). Do make the data available? I couldn't find it in any of the NC government-sponsored open data portals. Would they make the data available if I ask?

# Appendix 1: North Carolina

## There is some reuse of product_id values (unfortunately)

```{r}

n_sites <- nc_history %>%
  summarize(n = n_distinct(product_id)) %>%
  pull(n)

n_sites_by_facilility_id <- nc_history %>%
  group_by(facility_id) %>%
  summarize(n = n_distinct(product_id)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  pull(n) %>%
  sum()

n_sites_by_facilility_id_site_type_simple <- nc_history %>%
  group_by(facility_id, site_type_simple) %>%
  summarize(n = n_distinct(product_id)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  pull(n) %>%
  sum()

n_sites_by_facilility_id_site_type <- nc_history %>%
  group_by(facility_id, site_type) %>%
  summarize(n = n_distinct(product_id)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  pull(n) %>%
  sum()

product_id_counts <- tribble(
  ~ counting_method, ~ n_sites, ~ comment,
  # row 1
  "summarize(n = n_distinct(product_id))", 
  n_sites,
  "Baseline: simple count of distinct product_id values in data set",
  # row 2
  "group_by(facility_id) %>% summarize(n = n_distinct(product_id)) %>% ungroup() %>% pull(n) %>% sum()", 
  n_sites_by_facilility_id, 
  "Additional cases in which multiple facilities use the sampe product_id values",
  # row 3
  "group_by(facility_id, site_type_simple) %>% summarize(n = n_distinct(product_id)) %>% ungroup() %>% pull(n) %>% sum()",
  n_sites_by_facilility_id_site_type_simple, 
  "Additional cases in which multiple facilities use the same product_id values across multiple site_type_simple categories",
  # row 4
  "group_by(facility_id, site_type) %>% summarize(n = n_distinct(product_id)) %>% ngroup() %>% pull(n) %>% sum()", 
  n_sites_by_facilility_id_site_type, 
  "Additional cases in which multiple facilities use the sampe product_id values across more detailed multiple site_type categories"
) %>%
  mutate(delta = n_sites - lag(n_sites)) %>%
  relocate(delta, .after = n_sites)

product_id_diff <- max(product_id_counts$n_sites) - min(product_id_counts$n_sites)
product_id_diff_pct <- product_id_diff / max(product_id_counts$n_sites)

```

This complicates matters. Since the difference is at most `r product_id_diff` (`r percent(product_id_diff_pct)`), I generally work with counts calculated using "group_by(facility_id, site_type_simple)" and ignore the differences otherwise. 

<br>

```{r}

# Appendix 2: USA

## USA-level inventory

NC inventory on-boarding at recreation.gov seems generally consistent with the rest of the USA: 2008 was the first year that recreation.gov was able to offer reservations on nearly all of the existing camping facilities across the USA. So comparing later years with a 2009 baseline provides our best view of year-to-year increases in inventory in the parks. This includes some new or existing parks coming on-line as well, as seen above in the parks that have data only for very recent years.

```{r}
year_lower_bound <- 2009

parks_all_years_overnight_for_plot <- park_years %>%
  group_by(facility_id, facility_name, site_type_simple) %>%

            year_min = min(start_year, na.rm = TRUE),
            year_max = max(start_year, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(site_type_simple != "management") %>%
  mutate(site_type_simple = fct_reorder(site_type_simple, -n_years))

```

```{r fig.width=8}

Starting in 2009 each year saw a very small number of campgrounds adding newly reservable overnight site types. Again, these are for the whole USA.

It seems like normal growth in in 2009 and following years as facilities added additional types of sites and perhaps some new facilities opened. The overall compound annual growth rate^[Growth rate in the number of facilities offering the various types of overnight sites, each facility + site_type_simple counted once each year.] between `r year_lower_bound` and 2020 was `r percent(cagr, accuracy = 0.1)`, with some differences in the kinds of sites:

### Summary by state

### Limitations in USA-level data

The USA-level data does not include all reservable camping sites, presumably because they use a different reservation system. For example:

* Yellowstone Hotel and Cabins are not reservable via recreation.gov, but campgrounds and backcountry camping permits are
* Yosemite Creek Campground is not reservable, but other Yosemite campgrounds are
* No overnight facilities in Hawaii are reservable (are there any?)

In contrast: Great Smokey Mountain National Park campgrounds are all reservable.

Some recreation areas allow camping; only two in the data set are reservable; they are not included here.
