The secret is out. There are **more people** camping **more nights** at federally-owned facilities in North Carolina: the number of person-nights  nearly doubled 2013-2019 at the same facilities. As seen in *@fig-person-nights-by-dow-year-season NC person-nights camping each night of the week - on and off season* there were more people camping: year-on-year, every day of the week, in the summer and off season. The oddities of 2020 changed facility availability and campers' behavior (temporarily we all hope).

With rising popularity, reservations for the most popular facilities and campsites are occurring earlier. Most facilities take reservations starting six months in advance--some 12 months. But don't worry: especially for tent and RV camping, some sites are available at most facilities a week or two in advance. And some facilities have first-come, first-serve, non-reservable sites which don't show up in this data set.

In North Carolina the median per-person cost of camping is very low: around \$5 for tent and RV camping, \$3 for group camping, and \$20 for cabin "camping".

So what are you waiting for? Find a federally-owned campsite at [recreation.gov](https://https://www.recreation.gov) (or a state-owned campsite at [ReserveAmerica.com](https://ReserveAmerica.com)) and make a reservation today.

### I wondered ...

Inspired by Tyler McIntosh's article [The Camping Crunch: Camping's rise in popularity on America's public lands](https://westernpriorities.org/the-camping-crunch/)^[*The Camping Crunch: Camping's rise in popularity on America's public lands* was published Oct 21, 2021 on the website of the Center or Western Priorities at <https://westernpriorities.org/the-camping-crunch/>. I found it through a reference in Jeremy Singer-Vine's excellent newsletter [Data is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com) ], I decided to use the same data set from recreation.gov^[I downloaded the data set from <https://ridb.recreation.gov/download> on 2021-11-11, specifically: (1) overview information in RIDB Recreation Data at <https://ridb.recreation.gov/downloads/RIDBFullExport_V1_JSON.zip> and (2) historical data for each year FY 2006 - FY 2020 as zipped CSV files, e.g, <https://ridb.recreation.gov/downloads/reservations2020.zip> for 2020] to look at camping dynamics in North Carolina, where I live.

I wondered, in North Carolina ...

* What facilities are available?
    - What are the public facilities offering overnight camping, and where are they?
    - What types of sites do they offer?
    - How many are "big" (which I define as having at least `r big_campground_size` campsites)?
    - What is the distribution of the number of sites per facility?
    - Which government agencies provide these facilities?
* How many nights are people camping, and how has this changed over the years?
    - How many nights are people camping each year, and how has this been changing over time?
    - Which parks have become more popular in recent years? Have any become less popular?
    - How much revenue are parks collecting related to overnight camping, and how has this been changing?
* How full are the campgrounds, and how does occupancy vary?
    - How does the occupancy vary by day of week? By week of year? What changes have there been in occupancy rate over the years? Are some parks often at maximum occupancy?
* What patterns are there in reservations over time and for the various site types?
    - How far in advance do people reserve?
* What does it cost per person to camp in NC?
    - What does it cost to camp, and how has this changed over the years?
* How similar are the NC dynamics to the rest of the USA?
    - Are the dynamics similar to the rest of the country?
